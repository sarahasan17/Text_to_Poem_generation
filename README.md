# Text to Poem generation

## Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries

The foundation is laid with the importation of essential libraries. TensorFlow, enriched with Keras, takes center stage, paving the way for the implementation of a Bidirectional LSTM. Additional tools for data manipulation, visualization, and model building are summoned to enrich our toolkit.

## Step 2: Loading the Dataset and Exploratory Data Analysis

The poetic voyage begins by loading a dataset containing the rich tapestry of words. A poetic flourish is added through Exploratory Data Analysis, where a WordCloud unveils the visual symphony of the textual landscape, providing a glimpse into the essence of the data.

## Step 3: Creating the Corpus

The raw material for our linguistic masterpiece is meticulously crafted through the creation of a corpus. Textual seas are broken into poetic lines, laying the groundwork for the subsequent steps.

## Step 4: Fitting the Tokenizer on the Corpus

A linguistic apprentice, the Tokenizer, is introduced and tailored to the idiosyncrasies of our corpus. It learns the vocabulary, setting the stage for the model to comprehend the nuances of our poetic language.

## Step 5: Generating Embeddings/Vectorization

Embarking on the structural transformation of poetic lines, we generate embeddings - vectorized representations of our text. This process ensures that our unstructured text is rendered suitable for the voracious appetite of our model.

## Step 6: Building the Bi-directional LSTM Model

The architectural symphony unfolds as we construct a Bi-directional LSTM model. This model, akin to a literary maestro, is designed to capture the intricacies and nuances of our poetic language.

## Step 7: Model Training

The blank canvas of our model is imbued with the colors of poetic wisdom through an intensive training process. Over 150 epochs, the model refines its understanding, reaching a commendable accuracy, and evolving into a virtuoso in the art of poetry.

## Step 8: Generating Text using the Built Model

In the grand finale, our model, now a virtuoso, reveals its lyrical prowess. Given a seed text, it generates eloquent verses, showcasing the culmination of its training and the poetic tales it can weave.

This comprehensive and elegant process transforms raw text into a lyrical masterpiece, where every step contributes to the symphony of words and meanings.
